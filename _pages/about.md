About Me 
======
I am an Integrative Life Sciences PhD student at Virginia Commonwealth University with experience in single-cell genomic method development, multi-omic data integration, computational biology, and precision medicine. I am a member of the Biological Networks Laboratory in the VCU Department of Computer Science, under the supervision of Dr. Preetam Ghosh. I have led and co-authored multiple peer-reviewed publications in the fields of bioinformatics, machine learning, and cancer biology. 

I earned my BS/MS (Accelerated Program) in Bioinformatics at Virginia Commonwealth University in the Summer of 2023. In April 2025 I will be joining the Data, AI and Genome Sciences team at Merck as an AI/ML Co-Op in Cambridge, MA.
