About Me 
======
I am an Integrative Life Sciences PhD student at Virginia Commonwealth University with experience in single-cell genomic method development, multi-omic data integration, computational biology, and precision medicine. I am a member of the Biological Networks Laboratory in the VCU Department of Computer Science, under the supervision of Dr. Preetam Ghosh. I have lead and co-authored multiple peer-reviewed publications in the fields of bioinformatics, machine learning, and cancer biology. My extensive research and technical background, in combination with my community service and outreach leadership gives me a unique skillset to strategically approach multi-layered challenges in biomedicine.
