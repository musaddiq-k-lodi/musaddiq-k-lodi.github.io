### Research Interests  

I specialize in developing computational methods for single-cell multiomics analysis, with a strong focus on improving key analytical tasks in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). My research spans three major areas:  

1. **Designing novel algorithms** for cell type identification, gene regulatory network (GRN) inference, and marker gene identification.  
2. **Applying state-of-the-art single-cell analysis tools** to gain disease-specific insights in contexts such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, cancer therapeutics, and immune system interactions in blood cancer.  
3. **Integrating bulk and single-cell data** to enhance multiomic analyses.  

Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between computational method development and biomedical applications, ensuring that cutting-edge analytical tools contribute to meaningful biological discoveries. By combining robust computational frameworks with interdisciplinary collaborations, I strive to uncover key molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases and improve our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in health and disease.
