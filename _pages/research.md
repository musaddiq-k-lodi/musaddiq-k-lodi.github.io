### Research Interests  

My research focuses on developing computational methods for single-cell multiomics analysis, with an emphasis on improving key analytical tasks in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). I am particularly interested in advancing algorithms for analyzing cellular heterogeneity, understanding gene regulatory networks, and integrating multiomic datasets to uncover biologically meaningful patterns.  

In addition to method development, I apply state-of-the-art computational tools to gain insights into complex diseases, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and various cancers. By bridging computational innovation with biomedical applications, my work aims to enhance our understanding of cellular behavior and contribute to the development of precision medicine approaches.
